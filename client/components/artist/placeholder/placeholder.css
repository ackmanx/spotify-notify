 * This height is important
 * If it's too small, then on load there will be too many placeholders visible and react-lazyload will render them all because they're in the viewport
 * Worse yet, if you try to do a Find in Chrome, then Chrome will scroll there, but so many placeholders are in the viewport your searched-for content will load out of view
