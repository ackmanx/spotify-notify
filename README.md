# Remaining

* BUG: Extreme performance problems with huge list, selecting and deselecting  super-cpu intensive and has huge delays until state is reflected
    * Maybe I can optimize `markAsSeen`

* BUG: Clicking artist name twice adds again. The seenAlbums list in state needs to be a set.

* PROD: When I deploy, how will I backup my database?
    * Maybe have a script that will download it so I can version control updates periodically

* IDEA: Time to style this bitch
