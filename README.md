# Remaining

## Styled Components

## Convert to TypeScript

## Mobile friendly

## Docs
Explain how this works. 
Explain setup required (like in ganjing for heroku) but also mention Spotify developer dashboard and whitelisting URLs

## Generate a new client secret with spotify
Then add a heroku config for it and reference that in the code
For local development, I'll need to keep the secret handy outside of git, maybe read it from a file somewhere and make same env var that heroku uses

## Every Album instance on the page renders when you ghost an item
