# Remaining

* TRAINING: Introduce styled components

* TRAINING: Convert to TypeScript

* DOC: Explain how this works. Explain setup required (like in ganjing for heroku) but also mention Spotify developer dashboard and whitelisting URLs

* CHORE: generate a new client secret with spotify. then add a heroku config for it and reference that in the code
    * For local development, I'll need to keep the secret handy outside of git, maybe read it from a file somewhere and make same env var that heroku uses

* FEATURE: Mobile friendly

* CHORE: Add heroku env variable with mongodb url
