# Features

### Styled Components

### Convert to TypeScript

### Mobile friendly
Enlarge action bar 
For mobile, tapping album opens a modal 

### Generate a new client secret with spotify
Then add a heroku config for it and reference that in the code
For local development, I'll need to keep the secret handy outside of git, maybe read it from a file somewhere and make same env var that heroku uses

### Create modal to listen to that album RIGHT NOW
After modal open, generate an iframe to insert an embedded player
Use the album's URI so it shows the whole album

### Set a timer to refresh the page every 20 minutes
Does this work if the tab isn't the active tab?
Or should I use a chrome extension to reload it every 20 minutes so I can enable/disable it
Or should I re-do ganjing monorepo and make it work with non-chinese apps too?

# Bugs

### Every Album instance on the page renders when you ghost an item

# Chores

### Need a way to reset an artist because I mistakenly marked all of Krewella as seen
