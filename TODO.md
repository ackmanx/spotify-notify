# Features

### Styled Components

### Convert to TypeScript

### Mobile friendly
clean up css and modal code

### Generate a new client secret with spotify
Then add a heroku config for it and reference that in the code
For local development, I'll need to keep the secret handy outside of git, maybe read it from a file somewhere and make same env var that heroku uses

### Create modal to listen to that album RIGHT NOW
After modal open, generate an iframe to insert an embedded player
Use the album's URI so it shows the whole album
https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/widgets/generate/play-button/

### Have an option to view all albums, including seen
Would need a new UI for this
Combine action buttons to the left and add a hambuger to the right

# Bugs

### Every Album instance on the page renders when you ghost an item

# Chores

### Namespace my css or use Styled Components instead of avoiding it because I'm having conflicts
